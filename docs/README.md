# Docs

To go view Docs, go to the [EZCode Docs Wiki](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/wiki/EZCode-Docs).

- The Examples folder has a couple EZProject Examples.
- The Images folder contains images used in the docs.
- The WikiDocs_v2.0.0 contains the docs copy and pasted into this folder. It isn't updated so view the [wiki](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/wiki/EZCode-Docs) first if possible.
